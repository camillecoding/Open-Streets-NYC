# Open-Streets-NYC
This project created data visualizations in Tableau about New York City's Open Streets outdoor dining program.

## Background ##
The Open Streets outdoor dining program was launched in summer 2020 in response to the pandemic's impact on NYC restaurants. It was designed to support smaller restaurants that could not adhere to the requirement of 6 feet of distance between tables. Open Streets allowed restaurants to set up tables outdoors, and closed specific sections of streets to allow for more patronage. 

Although intended for good, it drew ire from some groups for various reasons. Private and for-hire drivers complained that this program inconvenienced them and did not facilitate travel. Some restaurants located away from an Open Street complained that they were excluded from benefitting from the program. Neighbors living on or near an "open" street complained that this program attracted vermin because restaurants were not diligent about cleaning food-related waste. Other neighbors complained because "open" streets were noisy. 

## Analysis

I wanted to research the design of the program itself, and find out whether certain boroughs or neighborhoods were disproportionally represented in this program - for better or worse. 

Manhattan had the greatest share of Open Streets, followed closely by Brooklyn. Although Queens is the largest borough based on size, Brooklyn is the largest based on population (as of July 2021).

Although Queens only had the third largest share of Open Streets, neighborhoods in Queens selected for Open Streets had much higher participation rates.

As a patronizing participant in this program, I relied on an existing understanding of NYC demographics by neighborhood. I used this knowledge to focus on the availability of Open Streets access. I concluded that based on available data, the neighborhoods represented were an appropriate sampling of the city.
